# DPA-Protected ALU Demo

This repo contains a partial demonstration of the DPA-Protected ALU source code, originally developed as part of an academic project.  

**Note:** This is not the full source code of the project.  
It includes selected files, to demonstrate SystemVerilog implementation and functional testing.

## Design Report
A detailed design report is available upon request.  
It covers the internal structure of the ALU, describes the test plan with waveform results, synthesis reports, analysis of the fresh-bit overhead and suggests future work.
